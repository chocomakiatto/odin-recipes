    This quick and easy version of French toast cooked in a mug doesn't dirty a bunch of dishes and the prep time is minimal. The recipe only uses the microwave for cooking so it is even safe for older children to prepare and feel successful in the kitchen. All of the ingredients used are refrigerator or pantry staples that are commonly on hand. This version calls for cubes of brioche bread, but you can feel free to use your favorite day-old bread that you have handy.

    Once the French toast comes out of the microwave, top with a pat of butter. Allow it to melt over the warm French toast cubes and then top with your favorite maple syrup. This quick and easy version of French toast can be enjoyed as an effortless breakfast in bed.
