  <p>
    <em>Shu</em> cream is a Japanese dessert inspired by the famous French "choux cream". Although these decadent puffs are French in origin, they have become a Japanese culinary staple that kids of many generations have grown up eating.
  </p>

  <p>
    When small individual choux pastry puffs are baked, the interior becomes light and airy, and the exterior turns crisp and golden. The puff is then filled with a sweet custard filliung. Before serving, the shu cream is gently dusted with confectioners' sugar.

  <p>This recipe makes eight puffs</p>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <h3>Make the Pastry</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat the oven to 375 F. Prepare a baking sheet by layering a piece of parchment paper or a silicone sheet.</li>
      <li>Beat the eggs in a small bowl and set aside.</li>
      <li>Place the butter, sugar, and water in a pan and bring to a boil over medium heat.</li>
      <li>Add the flour to the pan and incorporate into the butter mixture by stirring very quickly. Turn off the heat and remove the pan from the stove.</li>
      <li>Add the beaten eggs slowly into the pan with the dough mixture, stirring well with a wooden spoon. Mix well to avoid lumps in the dough—it should be smooth and even, firm but pliable.</li>
      <li>Fill a piping bag—or sturdy zip-close bag with a snipped corner—with the dough.</li>
      <li>Gently squeeze out 8 small mounds of dough onto the baking sheet. With wet hands, even out the surface of each little ball.</li>
      <li>Bake the puff pastry for 30 minutes. Allow the puffs to cool on a cooling rack.</li>
      <li>Cut the puffs in half horizontally. Reserve.</li>
    </ol>
  <h3>Make the Custard</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>In a medium-sized pan, mix the egg yolks and sugar, stirring well.</li>
      <li>Add the flour into the pan and mix well.</li>
      <li>Gradually add the warm milk into the egg mixture, stirring constantly.</li>
      <li>Place the pan on low heat and stir the mixture constantly until it has thickened, or about 5 to 7 minutes. </li>
      <li>Remove from heat and add the melted butter, mixing well.</li>
      <li>Let the cream cool off, covered in plastic wrap.</li>
    </ol>
  <h3>Assemble the Shu Cream</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Fill the bottom halves of puffs with a dollop of custard cream and cover with the top halves.</li>
      <li>Dust the finished cream puffs with confectioners' sugar.</li>
    </ol>
